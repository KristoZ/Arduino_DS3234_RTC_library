Arduino_DS3234_RTC_library
==========================

This is a library for the extremely accurate DS3234 SPI bus real time clock (RTC) for Arduino v1.x.
I assembled it from various sources from the internet with an intention to make it look and act as similar to the DS1307RTC library (which is bundled with the Time http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Time library) as possible. 
Example sketch included.
